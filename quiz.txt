Q: Why should the usage of java.util.Date be avoided?
A: For example: It's hard to compare 2 dates. Date uses the Unix timestamp. Even if we would compare the date of the same day (d1 == d2),

   LocalDate is the new API. Its easier and has more features like add or substract Days, Months or years.
   It even has its own parsing or formatting methods.
